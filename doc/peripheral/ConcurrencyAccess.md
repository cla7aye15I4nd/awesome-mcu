# Peripheral Access Concurrency Bugs
The internal struct of peripheral is a finite state machine, an **operator** of peripheral such as read/write a byte from UART may need multi-access to peripheral, single access will change the state (transition on FSM) of the peripheral once. The access sequence of a specific operator be defined a **transaction**. Usually, two transactions cannot be execute concurrently. In other words, a transaction should be atomic operator. So the peripheral can be seen as a resource in multithreading, peripheral access from the different tasks may lead to an error access sequence of peripheral.

## Examples

**USART struct:**

```c
typedef struct
{
  uint32_t SR;         /*!< USART Status register,                   Address offset: 0x00 */
  uint32_t DR;         /*!< USART Data register,                     Address offset: 0x04 */
  uint32_t BRR;        /*!< USART Baud rate register,                Address offset: 0x08 */
  uint32_t CR1;        /*!< USART Control register 1,                Address offset: 0x0C */
  uint32_t CR2;        /*!< USART Control register 2,                Address offset: 0x10 */
  uint32_t CR3;        /*!< USART Control register 3,                Address offset: 0x14 */
  uint32_t GTPR;       /*!< USART Guard time and prescaler register, Address offset: 0x18 */
} USART_TypeDef;
```

**Write Byte Sequence**: Read `SR` (TXE), Write `DR`, Read `SR`(TC).

**Concurrency Bugs demo**: 

| Task A   | Task B                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Read SR  |                                       |
|          | Read SR                               |
| Write DR |                                       |
|          | Write DR (cover Task A content !!!!!) |
| Read TC  |                                       |
|          | Read TC                               |

After write the DR, the UART will move the DR to UART buffer (shift register), but in the process task B cover the DR, the data from Task A are lost. The byte of Task A is not delivered.

## Real World Case

**SPI Thread Safe**: [Implement thread safety for all SPI devices](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/2317)

    To communicate with any device, the bus needs to: 
    (i) select the slave device and 
    (ii) read/write data from/to the device.
    These two steps represent the internal state machines of this bus. Now imagine step (i) is done by thread A, which is going to send a command to the LIS3DH sensor. Simultaneously, thread B makes the SPI bus choose another slave device, i.e., the SD
    card controller. In this case, thread Aâ€™s command will then be redirected to another slave device due to the transaction corruption of SPI caused by concurrent bus accesses.
